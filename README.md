# ANP Front-End

Front-End App that consumes data from obtained from anp-web-service's API.

## Getting Started

To begin, we run through our basic clone & install process:

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/mateus908/anp-web-site.git`
2. navigate into the project `cd anp-web-site`
3. Install the NodeJS dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Install the Bower dependencies: `bower install`.
5. Run gulp serve to begin our development: `gulp serve`.

The ANP Web Site has a simple login page. So you need to register before the first login.

## Gulp Commands

```sh
gulp serve            // Serves project from .tmp folder
gulp clean            // Removes any temporary folders
gulp serve:dist       // Serves project as it does for production builds
gulp builds           // Builds project to 'dist' folder
```
